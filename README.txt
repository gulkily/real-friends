Real-friends
============

Objective: Help you know that you've seen all your friends' updates.

Real-friends aims to solve a real problem that many people have:

After scrolling a newsfeed for 5, 10, 30 minutes, and seeing lots 
of junk that the platform wants us to see, going to individual 
friends' pages, and realizing that we still did not see their updates. 
It could be due to the newsfeed algorithm being crap, or due to us 
just missing those updates in the newsfeed, but the problem remains: 
there are important updates from our friends that we miss all the time,
all while seeing much less valuable content that the platform chooses 
for us.

Problem: Social media platforms don't give you an easy way to see 
all your friends' updates which you have not seen yet.

Solution: Real-friends solves this problem in the easiest way we 
could think of: making a list of people important to us, cataloging 
all their updates, and presenting the list of newest updates to the 
user, with the ability to mark them as read.

That's it! There may be more features coming in the future, but for now 
this seems like enough to make it a demanded product.
