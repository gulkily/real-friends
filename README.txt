real-friends
============

objective: help you know that you've seen all your friends' updates.

problem: social media platforms don't give you an easy way to see 
all your friends' updates which you have not seen yet.

solution: make a list of friends user wants to keep up with. scrape 
their updates from their profiles, and present a list of ones user 
have not seen yet. allow user to mark them as read.
